	<p>For five years, Daniel taught in the Children's Studies program at Eastern Washington University, an interdisciplinary academic field which treats children and their experiences holistically and strives to incorporate their rights and perspectives into the research about their lives. Daniel is also involved in the worlds of <a href="https://playeverything.wordpress.com/play-and-playwork/">Playwork</a> and <a href="http://adventureplaygrounds.hampshire.edu">adventure playgrounds</a>, <a href="http://www.tinkeringschool.com">DIY/Maker culture with children</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reggio_Emilia_approach">Reggio Emilia-inspired early childhood education</a>. He's also accidentally been called "Mom" by kids of all ages more times than he can count â€” a compliment he considers of the highest order.</p>
	<p>Currently, Daniel is taking a break from academic stuff to focus on writing screenplays and work on a few other creative projects. He's always open to new opportunities, though, so if you have one, don't hesitate to get in touch.</p>
	<p>You can get a hold of him <a href="mailto:hello@danielbigler.com">by email</a>, <a href="http://www.twitter.com/thisisdaniel/">Twitter</a>, or carrier pigeon (probably).</p>
